## üìö What is Time Series Analysis?
Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. It is widely used to:

- Forecast future values (e.g., stock prices, weather).
- Identify trends and seasonal patterns.
- Detect anomalies in data.
- Understand the impact of events over time.

### Example Use Cases:
- **Finance**: Predicting stock prices or portfolio performance.
- **Healthcare**: Monitoring patient vitals over time.
- **IoT**: Analyzing sensor data from devices.
